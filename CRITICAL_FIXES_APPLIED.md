# Critical Build Issues - RESOLVED ✅

## Summary
All critical build issues have been successfully resolved. The project now builds without errors.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Graz Library Breaking Changes (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** The `graz` library v0.3.4 had breaking API changes from previous versions:
- `mainnetChains` export was removed
- `GrazChain` type was removed
- `useSigners` hook was removed
- `configureGraz` API changed (no longer accepts `defaultChain`, requires `chains` array)

**Solution:**
- Created `/src/utils/graz/chains.ts` with proper `ChainInfo` configuration for Sommelier network
- Created `/src/utils/graz/helpers.ts` with custom `useSigners` implementation using `useOfflineSigners`
- Updated all imports to use the new chain configuration
- Fixed `configureGraz` calls to use `chains` array instead of `defaultChain`
- Added required `grazOptions` prop to `GrazProvider` components

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/bridge/index.tsx`
- `src/pages/snapshot/index.tsx`
- `src/components/_cards/BridgeCard/InputAmount.tsx`
- `src/components/_cards/BridgeCard/InputSommelierAddress.tsx`
- `src/components/_cards/SnapshotCard/InputSommelierAddress.tsx`
- `src/hooks/web3/useBridgeSommToEthTx.tsx`

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/graz/chains.ts` - Sommelier chain configuration
- `src/utils/graz/helpers.ts` - Helper functions for graz operations

### 2. ✅ Missing pino-pretty Module (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** The `pino-pretty` module was required by pino logger but not installed, and it has Node.js dependencies that don't work in browser contexts.

**Solution:**
- Installed `pino-pretty` as a dev dependency using `pnpm add -D pino-pretty`
- Updated webpack configuration in `next.config.js` to:
  - Ignore pino-pretty in client builds
  - Handle Node.js module prefixes (node:stream, node:worker_threads)
  - Add fallbacks for Node.js modules
  - Exclude pino from client bundle

**Files Modified:**
- `next.config.js` - Added webpack plugins and fallbacks

### 3. ✅ TypeScript Type Error (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Type mismatch in `ConnectWalletPopover.tsx` with responsive `minH` prop.

**Solution:**
- Simplified the `minH` prop to avoid responsive value type conflicts
- Changed from `minH={{ base: "48px", md: rest.minH }}` to `minH={rest.minH || "48px"}`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/_buttons/ConnectButton/ConnectWalletPopover.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Runtime Configuration Error (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** The snapshot page was trying to access undefined `sommelier` property.

**Solution:**
- Fixed by properly configuring the graz chains array with complete ChainInfo object
- Removed references to non-existent `mainnetChains.sommelier`

## Build Status

```bash
✓ Compiled successfully in 12.0s
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (42/42)
✓ Collecting build traces
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

## Remaining Non-Critical Issues

### ESLint Warnings (100+)
- Unused variables
- Use of `any` type
- Missing React display names
- React hooks dependencies
- TypeScript comment directives

These warnings do not prevent the build and can be addressed incrementally.

### TypeScript Version Warning
The project uses TypeScript 5.9.2 which is not officially supported by @typescript-eslint. Consider downgrading to a supported version (>=4.7.4 <5.6.0) if issues arise.

## Commands to Verify

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Type check
npm run typecheck

# Lint check
npm run lint
```

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to ensure functionality wasn't broken
2. Consider addressing ESLint warnings for code quality
3. Test the bridge and snapshot pages to ensure they work correctly
4. Consider upgrading or downgrading TypeScript to a supported version
5. Monitor for any runtime issues with the graz wallet integration
