    howItWorks: `ETH-BTC Trend strategy aims to provide a better risk-return tradeoff than holding ETH and/or BTC. The cellar accumulates BTC and ETH relative to USDC with a medium to long-term perspective. The
    rebalancing decision is based on price momentum and the asset with higher momentum is assigned to be overweight. The strategy aims to outperform the benchmarks and have lower volatility and risk than holding BTC or ETH individually or in an equally weighted portfolio of BTC and ETH.
    <br/><br/>
    The strategy is long only, but it reduces risk exposure if price momentum is negative. Backtests indicate the cellar will outperform at times when prices are rising moderately or one of the portfolio assets is appreciating faster than the other. The strategy is likely to underperform when there are extreme price appreciations but is expected to capture the majority of any positive price movements. The strategy is expected to outperform in a bear market since it can cut risk exposure, but it is exposed to negative price movements because it is long only and always holds at least a small proportion of risky assets. The benefits of the strategy should emerge within 3-6 month (i.e., medium term) holding period in case of diverse market conditions and are highly likely to emerge for holding periods over 1 year (i.e., long term).
    <br/><br/>
    The strategy is more sensitive to positive market movements than a trend-following strategy and is expected to provide slightly higher returns in a bull market than a similar trend-following strategy but lower returns in a bear market.`,

    howItWorks: `Every recommended trade always sets the trade risk immediately after the position is activated. The level of risk is determined by our proprietary algorithms and is optimized for modest risk tolerance. It is important to emphasize that having a risk limit does not imply a guaranteed risk price, as slippage can be exacerbated in uncertain market conditions. With the downside risk under pragmatic control, the strategy can shift focus to the realization of upside potential. The upside potential comprises two parts – a fixed target and a variable target. A fixed target is a reasonable expectation of modest favorable market movement, and a variable target is deliberately open-ended to facilitate the pursuit of an opportunistic movement in favor of the trade. The pursuit of a variable target is activated when the initial capital outlay for the trade has already been earned back and realized, thereby adding no incremental risk to the position.
    <br/><br/>
    With the visibility of the trade risk, the investor can focus on the capital-at-risk/risk appetite. Our approach towards capital management is prudence accompanied by a strategy to “stay in the game.” We recommend a capital allocation of 2.5%-5.0% per trade, which allows the investor to stay with the strategy for 40-20 consecutive losing trades. Of course, the actual risk tolerance of investors is on a broad spectrum, and some investors may even be comfortable with a 10-15% allocation per trade.
    <br/><br/>
    The trade management technique comprises two components: a workhorse and a racehorse. The point of the workhorse is to nullify risk and capture a small profit/cover transaction cost, and the point of the racehorse is to pursue a larger payoff opportunity. Capital allocation of 2.50% per trade strategy assigned equally to “Workhorse” and “Racehorse” (1.25% each).
    <br/><br/>
    ETH Long Trade example: A long trade is triggered when the market reaches the directional entry level. 2 positions on the long side are initiated by accumulating the ETH relative to USDC. Each position is immediately assigned a Target and a Stop (loss). If the market reaches the Target before the Stop, the workhorse BTC is sold for USDC, profit taken. Simultaneously, the racehorse Stop changes to a Trailing stop. At this point, the economic risk is nullified, a small profit is locked in, and the racehorse is pursuing a larger payoff potential.
