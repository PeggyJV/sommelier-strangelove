    howItWorks: `ETH-BTC Trend strategy aims to provide a better risk-return tradeoff than holding ETH and/or BTC. The cellar accumulates BTC and ETH relative to USDC with a medium to long-term perspective. The
    rebalancing decision is based on price momentum and the asset with higher momentum is assigned to be overweight. The strategy aims to outperform the benchmarks and have lower volatility and risk than holding BTC or ETH individually or in an equally weighted portfolio of BTC and ETH.
    <br/><br/>
    The strategy is long only, but it reduces risk exposure if price momentum is negative. Backtests indicate the cellar will outperform at times when prices are rising moderately or one of the portfolio assets is appreciating faster than the other. The strategy is likely to underperform when there are extreme price appreciations but is expected to capture the majority of any positive price movements. The strategy is expected to outperform in a bear market since it can cut risk exposure, but it is exposed to negative price movements because it is long only and always holds at least a small proportion of risky assets. The benefits of the strategy should emerge within 3-6 month (i.e., medium term) holding period in case of diverse market conditions and are highly likely to emerge for holding periods over 1 year (i.e., long term).
    <br/><br/>
    The strategy is more sensitive to positive market movements than a trend-following strategy and is expected to provide slightly higher returns in a bull market than a similar trend-following strategy but lower returns in a bear market.`,

    howItWorks: `Every recommended trade always sets the trade risk immediately after the position is activated. The level of risk is determined by our proprietary algorithms and is optimized for modest risk tolerance. It is important to emphasize that having a risk limit does not imply a guaranteed risk price, as slippage can be exacerbated in uncertain market conditions. With the downside risk under pragmatic control, the strategy can shift focus to the realization of upside potential. The upside potential comprises two parts – a fixed target and a variable target. A fixed target is a reasonable expectation of modest favorable market movement, and a variable target is deliberately open-ended to facilitate the pursuit of an opportunistic movement in favor of the trade. The pursuit of a variable target is activated when the initial capital outlay for the trade has already been earned back and realized, thereby adding no incremental risk to the position.
    <br/><br/>
    With the visibility of the trade risk, the investor can focus on the capital-at-risk/risk appetite. Our approach towards capital management is prudence accompanied by a strategy to “stay in the game.” We recommend a capital allocation of 2.5%-5.0% per trade, which allows the investor to stay with the strategy for 40-20 consecutive losing trades. Of course, the actual risk tolerance of investors is on a broad spectrum, and some investors may even be comfortable with a 10-15% allocation per trade.
    <br/><br/>
    The trade management technique comprises two components: a workhorse and a racehorse. The point of the workhorse is to nullify risk and capture a small profit/cover transaction cost, and the point of the racehorse is to pursue a larger payoff opportunity. Capital allocation of 2.50% per trade strategy assigned equally to “Workhorse” and “Racehorse” (1.25% each).
    <br/><br/>
    ETH Long Trade example: A long trade is triggered when the market reaches the directional entry level. 2 positions on the long side are initiated by accumulating the ETH relative to USDC. Each position is immediately assigned a Target and a Stop (loss). If the market reaches the Target before the Stop, the workhorse BTC is sold for USDC, profit taken. Simultaneously, the racehorse Stop changes to a Trailing stop. At this point, the economic risk is nullified, a small profit is locked in, and the racehorse is pursuing a larger payoff potential.

      description: `Patache has pursued a pragmatic approach to developing a trading strategy instead of a strict theoretical framework. A foundation of our pragmatic approach is a "risk first" paradigm – capital preservation is prioritized over capital growth. The strategy emphasizes principal protection and steady, consistent returns while pursuing occasional "home runs."
      <br/><br/>
      The trade management technique of Steady MATIC strategy comprises two components: a workhorse and a racehorse. The point of the workhorse is to nullify risk and capture a small profit/cover transaction cost, and the point of the racehorse is to pursue a larger payoff opportunity. Check the "How it works" section for detailed strategy performance explanations.
      <br/><br/>
      The Strategy is expected to capture most of any positive price breakouts and limit losses through its trailing stops. Due to the nature of the strategy, it is designed for the Cellar participant to remain committed over a medium to long term time frame (6 months to a year). In this time the benefits of being in the strategy are expected to emerge.`,
    },
    howItWorks: `Every recommended trade always sets the trade risk immediately after the position is activated. The level of risk is determined by our proprietary algorithms and is optimized for modest risk tolerance. It is important to emphasize that having a risk limit does not imply a guaranteed risk price, as slippage can be exacerbated in uncertain market conditions. With the downside risk under pragmatic control, the strategy can shift focus to the realization of upside potential. The upside potential comprises two parts – a fixed target and a variable target. A fixed target is a reasonable expectation of modest favorable market movement, and a variable target is deliberately open-ended to facilitate the pursuit of an opportunistic movement in favor of the trade. The pursuit of a variable target is activated when the initial capital outlay for the trade has already been earned back and realized, thereby adding no incremental risk to the position.
    <br/><br/>
    With the visibility of the trade risk, the investor can focus on the capital-at-risk/risk appetite. Our approach towards capital management is prudence accompanied by a strategy to “stay in the game.” We recommend a capital allocation of 2.5%-5.0% per trade, which allows the investor to stay with the strategy for 40-20 consecutive losing trades. Of course, the actual risk tolerance of investors is on a broad spectrum, and some investors may even be comfortable with a 10-15% allocation per trade.
    <br/><br/>
    The trade management technique comprises two components: a workhorse and a racehorse. The point of the workhorse is to nullify risk and capture a small profit/cover transaction cost, and the point of the racehorse is to pursue a larger payoff opportunity. Capital allocation of 2.50% per trade strategy assigned equally to “Workhorse” and “Racehorse” (1.25% each).
    <br/><br/>
    MATIC Long Trade example: A long trade is triggered when the market reaches the directional entry level. 2 positions on the long side are initiated by accumulating the MATIC relative to USDC. Each position is immediately assigned a Target and a Stop (loss). If the market reaches the Target before the Stop, the workhorse MATIC is sold for USDC, profit taken. Simultaneously, the racehorse Stop changes to a Trailing stop. At this point, the economic risk is nullified, a small profit is locked in, and the racehorse is pursuing a larger payoff potential.

      description: `Real Yield USD has a real technological edge to deliver yields others can't.
      <br/><br/>
      By “real yield” we mean yield that results from trading or lending activity (fees) rather than resulting from incentives. The primary sources of real yield exist on lending platforms like Aave and Compound, and decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. Because of this, Real Yield USD focuses on these three protocols and simultaneously allocates capital to Aave and Compound lending pools and Uniswap V3 LP pools in order to maximize yield.
      <br/><br/>
      One important reason that the Real Yield USD Strategy is able to achieve superior yields is that it can actively optimize Uniswap V3 tick ranges. Many other yield strategies can't handle this complexity and therefore just stick to lending optimization. By combining lending and LPing, Real Yield USD aims to provide higher sustained yields than simple lending or LPing strategies.`,
    },
    howItWorks: `Determining the optimal allocation of stablecoins across these three protocols for the highest yield is non-trivial and requires off-chain computation.
    <br/><br/>
    Sommelier's novel infrastructure enables active optimization of capital of an erc-4626 vault (guided by off-chain computation) while remaining non-custodial, transparent, and decentralized. The optimal allocation is determined by a numerical optimization procedure that accounts for swap fees and market impact due to position size, and makes use of various simple time-series forecasting methods to estimate (future) base yields.
    <br/><br/>
    One important reason that the Real Yield USD Strategy is able to achieve superior yields is that it optimizes Uniswap V3 tick ranges. Picking a lending position on Aave or Compound is relatively easy (ignoring factors like market impact which are actually important) because there are no degrees of freedom - it simply boils down to the decision of whether to lend a certain token or not. Providing liquidity on Uniswap V3, on the other hand, is complex because the choice of tick range determines both fee revenue and impermanent loss. Our optimization procedure accounts for all of these factors.`,

    howItWorks: `The vault will initially generate yield using two primary techniques, but has the ability to integrate with other protocols for new capabilities in the future. The techniques initially used in the vault:
    <br/><br/>
    1. Leveraged Staking: This method involves a continuous cycle of exchanging ETH for an ETH denominated LST, utilizing the LST as collateral on Aave or Compound, borrowing more ETH, and repeating the cycle. This process is commonly referred to as “looping.”
    <br/><br/>
    2. Liquidity Provisioning: This approach involves providing liquidity to ETH/ ETH denominated LST trading pairs on Uniswap V3. As a liquidity provider (LP), the vault deposits both ETH and an LST into a liquidity pool, earning fees from traders who swap between the two tokens.
    <br/><br/>
    Sommelier’s novel architecture gives the vault advanced capabilities when it comes to both leveraged staking and liquidity provision strategies. More specifically, for leveraged staking, the vault uses a sophisticated solution to accumulate leverage that is highly capital efficient and significantly reduces gas and flash loan fees frequently associated with typical leverage practices. While the vault is leveraged, its smart contract enforces a minimum 1.05 health factor during each rebalance as a safety precaution and the vault closely monitors on-chain conditions to mitigate liquidation risk. If market conditions change, the vault is able to rapidly adjust leverage ratios to help avoid liquidation.
    <br/><br/>
    For the liquidity provision strategies, the vault’s ability to run off-chain computation combined with Seven Seas’ deep Uniswap V3 experience, positions the vault to be a top performing LP in the pools that it utilizes. The vault will be able to dynamically adapt to changing price movements to quote the optimal tick range(s) that collect the most fees while minimizing impermanent loss.

    The way the vault achieves this is by taking your deposited SNX token, supplying it on Aave as collateral to borrow ETH and then depositing that ETH into the Real Yield ETH vault. For context, the Real Yield ETH vault generates yield from leveraged staking and LPing ETH and ETH LSTs. The desired net effect is that the yield earned through Real Yield ETH will be greater than the borrow costs of the ETH allowing the vault to purchase more of your deposit token to add to your position. It’s important to note that these vaults and the Real Yield ETH vault take on leverage. However, Sommelier’s novel architecture gives vaults advanced capabilities when it comes to taking on and monitoring these positions. While leveraged, the vault smart contract enforces a minimum health factor during each rebalance as a safety precaution. The vault also closely monitors on-chain conditions to mitigate liquidation risk. If market conditions change, the vault is able to rapidly adjust leverage ratios to help avoid liquidation.`,

    On Fraxlend, the yield offered to FRAX suppliers is characteristically volatile, which offers opportunities but also requires constant monitoring and repositioning. The money market accepts a wide variety of smaller cap tokens as collateral, making for fluctuating yield opportunities ranging from 0.5% to more than 20%.
