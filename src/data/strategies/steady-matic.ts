    highlights: `The cellar:

      - "Risk first" approach - capital preservation is prioritized over capital growth.

      - Always defined risk for every position prevailing from trade inception until trade exit. Increased risk profile for Steady UNI/MATIC strategies vs Steady ETH or Steady BTC.

      - Each trade strategy comprises two independent trade orders: 1 "Workhorse"  with a fixed target to lock in some return and stop + 1 "Racehorse" with a trailing stop to capture market upside.`,
    description: `Patache has pursued a pragmatic approach to developing a trading strategy instead of a strict theoretical framework. A foundation of our pragmatic approach is a "risk first" paradigm – capital preservation is prioritized over capital growth. The strategy emphasizes principal protection and steady, consistent returns while pursuing occasional "home runs."

The trade management technique of Steady MATIC strategy comprises two components: a workhorse and a racehorse. The point of the workhorse is to nullify risk and capture a small profit/cover transaction cost, and the point of the racehorse is to pursue a larger payoff opportunity. Check the "How it works" section for detailed strategy performance explanations.

The Strategy is expected to capture most of any positive price breakouts and limit losses through its trailing stops. Due to the nature of the strategy, it is designed for the Cellar participant to remain committed over a medium to long term time frame (6 months to a year). In this time the benefits of being in the strategy are expected to emerge."
