    - Accepts eETH, weETH and WETH deposits.
    - Leverage loop weETH for more EigenLayer and ether.fi points (subject to borrow capacity on Morpho Blue).
    - Dynamically liquidity provision across multiple DEXs.
    - Fully automated with built-in auto compounding.`,

    description: `Turbo eETH aims to be your gateway to EigenLayer liquid restaking and ether.fi's DeFi ecosystem. The vault will pursue a number of DeFi strategies, including leveraged staking weETH to maximize EigenLayer and ether.fi points as well as LPing to eETH pairs on DEXs.

    risks: `All Sommelier vaults contain smart contract risk and varying degrees of economic risk. Please take note of the following risks; however, this list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks:
   
    - This vault does liquidity provision which can result in impermanent loss.
    - This vault uses leverage, which means there is liquidation risk.
