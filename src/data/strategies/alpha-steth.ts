    goals: `To offer access to curated reward opportunities on stETH by reallocating across trusted blue-chip DeFi protocols.`,

    highlights: `
    -Actively shifts leverage between top lending protocols (AAVE, Morpho, Euler) based on optimal borrowing rates.
    -Provides exposure to Unichain LP opportunities for reward diversification.
    -Allocates into Mellow vaults utilizing dvSTETH to unlock ETH-native rewards.
    -Automated strategy execution and auto-compounding.
    -Additional rewards may be enabled through Lido incentives. `,

    description: `
    Alpha STETH represents the next evolution in ETH reward strategies, combining dynamic capital management with diversified blue-chip primitives. The strategy reallocates across lending markets (AAVE, Morpho, Euler), Unichain liquidity pools, and Mellow vaults (via dvSTETH), based on real-time reward signals and protocol performance. Smart automation enables seamless execution and compounding while maintaining exposure to trusted DeFi strategies.

    Note that Alpha STETH and Sommelier vaults are not open to persons or citizens of the United States and other restricted countries â€“ for more details please refer to the Sommelier <a href="https://app.sommelier.finance/user-terms" style="textDecoration:underline"  target="_blank">User Terms</a>
    `,
    Risks: `
    All Sommelier vaults contain smart contract risk and varying degrees of economic risk. Please take note of the following risks; however, this list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks:

    - This vault uses leverage which presents a risk for the vault to be liquidated. Although there are safeguards in place to help mitigate this, the liquidation risk is not eliminated.

    - This vault does liquidity provision which can result in impermanent loss.

      question: "Are the smart contracts audited?",
      answer:
        "Yes, all smart contracts on Somm have been audited by an independent third-party auditor. And you can find the link of audit reports here <a style='border-bottom: 1px solid; border-color:white' href='https://www.sommelier.finance/audits' target='_blank'>sommelier.finance/audits</a>",

      question: "How is Alpha STETH different from TurboSTETH?",
      answer: `Alpha STETH leverages an upgraded vault architecture to access new reward opportunities across a broader set of DeFi protocols. While TurboSTETH primarily focused on classic leverage loops, Alpha STETH incorporates advanced strategies including Morpho and Euler lending, ETH L2 and more - offering a more flexible and diversified approach to ETH-native reward strategies.`,
