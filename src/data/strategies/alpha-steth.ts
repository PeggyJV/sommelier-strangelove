    description: `
    Lidoâ€™s stETH is one of the most well-regarded and widely used ETH LSTs in DeFi. Its numerous DeFi integrations and deep liquidity make it an attractive asset to use for dynamic Sommelier strategies. This vault will focus on dynamically providing liquidity across leverage staking, concentrated liquidity provision on DEXs and LST-ETH peg arbitrage to optimize ETH yields for users.
    
    Note that Alpha stETH and Sommelier vaults are not open to persons or citizens of the United States and other restricted countries - for more details please refer to the Sommelier <a href="https://app.sommelier.finance/user-terms" style="textDecoration:underline"  target="_blank">User Terms</a>
    `,
    Risks: `
    All Sommelier vaults contain smart contract risk and varying degrees of economic risk. Please take note of the following risks; however, this list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks:

    - This vault uses leverage which presents a risk for the vault to be liquidated. Although there are safeguards in place to help mitigate this, the liquidation risk is not eliminated.    
    
    - This vault does liquidity provision which can result in impermanent loss.
