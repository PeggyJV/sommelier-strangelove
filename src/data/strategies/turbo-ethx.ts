    Note that Turbo ETHx and Somm vaults are not open to persons or citizens of the United States and other restricted countries - for more details please refer to the Somm <a href="https://app.sommelier.finance/user-terms" style="textDecoration:underline"  target="_blank">User Terms</a>`,
    Risks: `
    All Somm vaults contain smart contract risk and varying degrees of economic risk. Please take note of the following risks; however, this list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks:

    - This vault has exposure to ETHx, an emerging LST, which means that it is more susceptible to depegs than its more established counterparts.
    - This vault may use leverage in the future, which means there is liquidation risk.`,
