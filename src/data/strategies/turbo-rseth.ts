    highlights: `
    - Accepts WETH and rsETH deposits.
    - Leverage loop rsETH for more EigenLayer and Kelp Miles (subject to borrow capacity on Morpho Blue).
    - Dynamically liquidity provision across multiple DEXs.
    - Fully automated with built-in auto compounding.`,

    risks: `All Somm vaults contain smart contract risk and varying degrees of economic risk. Please take note of the following risks; however, this list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks:
   
    - This vault does liquidity provision which can result in impermanent loss.
    - This vault uses leverage, which means there is liquidation risk.
