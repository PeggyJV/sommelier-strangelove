    Note that Real Yield ETH and Somm vaults are not open to persons or citizens of the United States and other restricted countries - for more details please refer to the Somm <a href="https://app.sommelier.finance/user-terms" style="textDecoration:underline"  target="_blank">User Terms</a>`,
    risks: `All Somm vaults contain smart contract risk and varying degrees of economic risk. Please take note of the following risks; however, this list is not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks:
    
    - 1 steth=1 weth is not hard coded in Aave on Arbitrum unlike Ethereum mainnet. There is a depeg risk for steth.
    - Borrow rates on Aave have been far more volatile than borrow rates on Ethereum on Ethereum . 
    - This vault uses leverage, which means there is liquidation risk.
