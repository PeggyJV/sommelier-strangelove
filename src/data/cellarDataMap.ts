The goal is to outperform a static strategy of lending any single stablecoin. Returns are amplified for Sommelier users as they will not suffer opportunity costs from passively sitting in less profitable lending positions at any given moment.`,
      strategy: `This strategy involves observation of several variables including Aave interest rates, rate volatility, gas fees, slippage estimations, and TVL. This data is the input for a custom predictive model which recommends position adjustments periodically. The entire process is automated as the model delivers a feed to Sommelier validators who relay necessary function calls to the Cellar.

      "somm alpha": `The alpha Sommelier delivers for this strategy is generated by a brilliant model that determines the precise moment that is best to capitalize on new market conditions. For the first time in DeFi history, you can benefit from a dynamic model rather than relying on static vault architecture. Cellars are not limited by rigid smart contract code which only allows positions to be adjusted under a narrow set of circumstances.

      The Aave Strategy uses high-powered predictive analytics to respond instantly when opportunity arises. Every second, we are monitoring and predicting APYs, gas fees, price volatility, liquidity, slippage and more. Rather than a simple formula such as "if gas fees <= current_apy/12, {claim_rewards}", the Aave Strategy is continually primed with real-time data points to make intelligent decisions. We bring statistics to DeFi without compromising decentralization. This has never been possible until now.`,

      The strategy is long only but cuts risk exposure when the price trends are negative. The cellar is based on backtests and is expected to outperform at times when price increases are moderate and to outperform significantly and reduce risks in a bear market. The strategy is likely to underperform in sideways markets or when prices are rising extremely quickly (because of being long only and not using leverage). The cellar is expected to capture the majority of any positive price trends, but it will always enter the market only after the trend has started to be positive. The strategy will limit losses if price movements are negative with the expectation of improving the risk-reward ratio. The benefits of the strategy can emerge within 3-6 month (i.e., medium term) holding period in case of diverse market conditions and are highly likely to emerge for holding periods over 1 year (i.e., long term).`,

The strategy is likely to underperform when there are extreme price appreciations but is expected to capture the majority of any positive price movements. The strategy is expected to outperform in a bear market since it can cut risk exposure, but it is exposed to negative price movements because it is long only and always holds at least a small proportion of risky assets.
