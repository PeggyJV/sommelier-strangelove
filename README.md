## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh

# using yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Interacting with contracts
Viem and wagmi libraries are used for interacting with contracts.

Instead of creating new contract objects, you can import the existing contract from the [`useCreateContracts`](./src/data/hooks/useCreateContracts.tsx) hook and use it in the components.

- [Viem Documentation](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract)
- [Wagmi Documentation](https://wagmi.sh/react/getting-started)

Calling methods syntax:
```
contract.(estimateGas|read|simulate|write).(functionName)(args, options)
```


Examples of reading and writing:
```ts
import { useCreateContracts } from "data/hooks/useCreateContracts"

const { cellarSigner } = useCreateContracts(cellarConfig)

const [isSupported, holdingPosition, depositFee] = await cellarSigner?.read.alternativeAssetData([
          assetAddress
        ]
  ) as [boolean, number, number]

const hash = cellarSigner?.write.deposit(
        [amtInWei, address],
        { gas: gasLimitEstimated, account: address }
  )
```

`read` call returns a single value or a list of values. The types can be seen from the contract abi.

`write` call returns tx hash.

# IP Detection using Vercel's headers

In order to block access to the app from sanctioned and restricted countries we are using Vercel's `x-vercel-ip-country` and `x-vercel-ip-country-region` to detect IP addresses. This is setup via a Next.js API route which reads the file from disk and performs a lookup against the IP. See `src/pages/api/geo.ts`.

The endpoint is hardcoded to use a restricted region unless you set the env vars `IP_COUNTRY`, and `IP_COUTNRY_REGION` (eg. `IP_COUNTRY='CA'` `IP_COUNTRY_REGION='BC'`). This API endpoint is then used by our GeoProvider (see `src/context/geoContext.tsx`). You can import the `useGeo()` hook to get access to the user's country, region, and a boolean that determines if they are in a restricted region or not. It's currently beging used in the `<Layout />` component to display a "Service Unavailable" banner and to block a user from connecting their wallet to the app.

# Multiple Sources of Truth

Unfortunately, as of writing this (03.08.22), there are multiple sources of truth cobbled together to present data to the user in the UI.

## Hardcoded values

Files of note:

- [`config.ts`](./src/utils/config.ts)
- [`cellarDataMap.ts`](./src/data/cellarDataMap.ts)
- [`tokenConfig.ts`](./src/data/tokenConfig.ts)

I outline these because they are the hardcoded data used to present asset symbols, apy, supported chains, etc. `cellarDataMap.ts` in particular is extensible, but the most fragile. It depends on an up-to-date cellar address to display the data correctly at a given cellar route. We have it set up to pull in that string from the `config.ts` file, but this certainly needs to be refactored in the future as we continue to support more strategies.

## Data Flow

Files of note:

- [`config.ts`](./src/utils/config.ts)
- [`data/cellarDataMap.ts`](./src/data/cellarDataMap.ts)
- [`data/hooks/*`](./src/data/hooks/)
- [`data/actions/*`](./src/data/actions/)

### Getting the data

If there's a new cellar with a different cellar or cellar router or staker contract that has a different ABI and output value, we should create output actions for it inside `data/actions/{CONTRACT_NAME_VERSION}/{outputName}`.

#### Data flow

![data flow](./data-flow.png)

Data reused to save fetch and data sharing efficiency through react query fetch strategy

## Displaying/Branching UI output

In the case we don't show specific UI output per cellar, We can specify what will be displayed or not inside /src/data/uiConfig.ts. Each function needs to be passed ConfigProps.

example:
We show "Rewards" only on `aave v2` cellar

```tsx
// src/data/uiConfig.ts
export const isRewardsEnabled = (config: ConfigProps) => {
  return config.cellarNameKey === CellarNameKey.AAVE
}

// somewhere in ui component
isRewardsEnabled(cellarConfig) && <RewardsCard />
```
